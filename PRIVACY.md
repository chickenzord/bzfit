# Privacy Policy

**BzFit** — Last updated: February 2026

## Overview

BzFit is a self-hosted calorie tracking application. This means you (or your organization) operate the server that stores your data. The BzFit developers do not have access to your data.

## Data We Collect

When you use BzFit, the following data is stored on your self-hosted server:

- Account information: email address and hashed password
- Meal logs: foods, serving sizes, quantities, and dates
- Nutrition goals: daily calorie and macronutrient targets
- Food catalog entries you create or import
- API keys you generate for external access

## How Your Data Is Used

Your data is used solely to provide the calorie tracking functionality of the app. It is never sold, shared with third parties, or used for advertising.

## Data Storage

All data is stored in the database on the server you deploy BzFit on. You are responsible for the security and backup of that server. BzFit does not transmit your data to any external service.

## Authentication

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage. Authentication tokens (JWT) are short-lived and stored locally on your device. API keys are hashed before storage.

## Third-Party Services

BzFit does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. No data leaves your server.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your account and all associated data by contacting the administrator of your BzFit instance. If you self-host, you have direct access to the database to remove your data at any time.

## Contact

Questions about this privacy policy should be directed to the administrator of the BzFit instance you are using.
